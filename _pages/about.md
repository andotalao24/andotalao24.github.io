## About me

I am a first-year Master student in Computer Science at UMass Amherst. I finished my undergraduate study in Computer Science at HKUST. 
I am enthusiastic about ML research, especially on label-efficient learning / weakly-supervised learning and trustworthy AI. I am particularly interested in applying the implications of these two directions to medical science where labeled data are expensive and scarce. In the past, I worked on various tasks with diverse kinds of data including texts, graphs and videos. I currently focus on efficient machine learning for NLP especially in a low-resource scenario. I am also broadly interested in transfer learning, imbalanced learning, meta learning, and explainability.

## Featured Research

I'm mainly interested in the research of Natural Lang
