I am a first-year Master student in Computer Science at UMass Amherst where I am lucky to do research at [IESL lab](http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/). I finished my undergraduate study in Computer Science at HKUST in 2022. In the past, I was a research assitant at [SMART lab](https://hkustsmartlab.netlify.app/) and an NLP research intern at [IDEA](https://www.idea.edu.cn/en). I am especially interested in label-efficient learning / weakly-supervised learning and trustworthy AI. I am particularly enthusiastic about applying the implications of those directions to biology where labeled data are expensive and scarce.   In the past, I worked on various tasks with diverse kinds of data including texts, graphs and videos. I currently focus on efficient methods for NLP in a low-resource scenario. I am also broadly interested in transfer learning, imbalanced learning, meta learning, and explainability.

## Featured Research

I'm mainly interested in the research of Natural Lang
