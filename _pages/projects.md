## Featured  
**Improving fairness of Large Language Models**  June 2023 - Current  
*supervised by Prof. Mengye Ren, Dr. Zhun Deng and Prof. James Zou*  

- Working on understanding the effects of supervised finetuning on LLMs for debiasing from the view of continual learning.  

**Large Language Models for clinical applications** Feb 2023 - Current  
*supervised by Prof. Yu Hong*  

- Working on automatic Chain-of-Thought generation for clinical QA to resolve shortage of annotations. 
- Working on improving zero-shot QA performance by adding medical jargons to prompts.
- Two papers in preparation. 


**Few-shot parsing for biomedical texts** Sep 2022 – Current  
*supervised by Prof. [Andrew McCallum](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yILa1y0AAAAJ)*  

- Focused on few-shot constituency parsing. Worked on knowledge distillation from LLMs to a smaller applicable language
model (i.e., T5).  
- Worked on understanding the performance difference between student and teacher in knowledge distillation. Worked on more effective KD methods to handle noise in teacher labels.
- Two papers in submission.


**Patella segmentation for the early detection of osteoarthritis** June 2021 – October 2021  
*Supervised by Prof. [Hao Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z_t5DjwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)*  

- Worked on increasing the robustness and data-efficiency of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) by
leveraging Statistical Shape Model (SSM) for Patella segmentation.  
- Implemented automated sampling and image registration to generate SSM. Proposed a metric for predicting whether
CNN or SSM performs better with no access to ground truth. Proposed a fuzzy nearest-neighbor framework to integrate
prior anatomical knowledge into CNN-based segmentation. It can improve the robustness and interpretability of segmentation
in the case of limited or corrupted data.  
- The proposal can increase the Dice coefficient of various mainstream CNN frameworks by around 1.7% on blind tests. The tested models can achieve a much better performance when only half of the training data are given.   


**Event detection without triggers** September 2021 – January 2022  
*supervised by Prof. [Haiqin Yang](https://hqyang.github.io/)*
- Worked on low-resource events detection that does not require the annotation of trigger words. Proposed to convert the
classification task into a reading comprehension (RC) task.  
- Proposed an events derangement module to resolve the imbalanced learning process. The performance on detecting minority events can be strengthened. Two patents are under registration.  
- Trained the proposed model with real large-scale data collected by Datastory and applied the model to the company’s product for efficient events detection on large-scale real data from social medias. The cost of data annotation was greatly reduced.

## Others  
**Deep learning in time series forecasting for epidemics** Dec 2021 – May 2022  
*Final year project, supervised by Prof. [Dit-Yan YEUNG](https://sites.google.com/view/dyyeung)*  

- Worked on zero-shot and few-shot time series prediction to forecast the spread of a local pandemic at its early stage.
Designed and built a meta-learning framework for time-series to leverage history data across regions to tackle the scarcity
of data. 


**Implicit discourse relation classification** February 2021 – May 2021  
*Supervised by Prof. [Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/)*  

- Applied BERT to the classification of implicit discourse relations. Proposed to focus on the long-tail recognition to
improve the classification performance.  
- Experimented with various methods including data augmentation, loss function modification (e.g., Focal Loss), transfer
learning and multi-task learning to improve the performance on minority class. The F1 score of the base model can be at
best increased by 2.1%.  


**Video analysis for the management of crowds** April 2020 – August 2020  
*Supervised by Prof. [Shueng-Han Gary Chan](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~gchan/)*  

- Applied YOLO and deepSORT to realize real-time indoor crowds detection and tracking on a single camera. Developed
algorithms to analyze indoor crowds’ staying time and monitor social distancing.  
- Further developed a naive framework on multi-camera multi-target tracking, which was an open research topic by then.
